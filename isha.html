        <p> Those words infuriate me, but I somehow prevent my rage from boiling
            over. I stand and pick up my plate. “Really, Ryle? I ask for the key to my

            We agreed to this arrangement, but he’s acting like that was for my
            benefit rather than his. He knows I could have taken him to court for sole
            custody after everything he put me through. Hell, I never even had him
            arrested. He should be grateful I’ve been as generous as I have.

            counter, allowing my head to drop between my shoulders. Calm down, Lily.
